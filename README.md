# ML-Based-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, at first, I split the dataset as a training set and validation set. Then
I apply Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM and a Neural Network based model i.e.,
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to train the model.
Later, I classify the positive and negative comments with proper accuracy. Finally, I
calculate the precision, recall and F measure.
